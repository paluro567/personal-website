## About  Me
My name is Peter Luro, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for building sofisticated scalable solutions that tackle complex tasks. I have over 3 years of professional experiencee working in the software industry and have had the opportunity to work on some exciting and impaactful technologies for the teams that I have been a part of.

When it comes to software development, I strive to be a teamplayer. I enjoy working closely with my colleagues and stakeholders to understand their needs and goals. This has always resulted in creative solutions that meet their requirements while also adhering to best practices and industry standards.

Outside of work, I enjoy scripting useful functionality for my stock trading alerting Python application. 

If you're interested in learning more about my experience and skills, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I'd love to chat about how I can help your organization achieve its goals through software engineering.
