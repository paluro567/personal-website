I have over 3 years of professional experience working in the software industry and have had the opportunity to work on some exciting and impactful technologies.</p> <p>When it comes to software development, I strive to be a team player. I enjoy working closely with my colleagues and stakeholders to understand their business needs and goals. This has always resulted in creative solutions that meet their requirements while also adhering to best practices and industry standards.</p> <p>Outside of work, I enjoy scripting useful functionality for my stock alerting Python application. The application utilizes the Python Requests library with HTTP GET requests to pull stock recommendations from various source each day. Then the Python Yfinance library is used to acquire real time price data for a given day. I am able to receive text notifications on potential breakouts through the Twilio texting API.</p> <p>If you're interested in learning more about my experience and skills, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I'd love to elaborate on how I can help your organization achieve its goals through software engineering!</p>"},{"location":"#education","title":"Education","text":"<p>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science - Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) - GPA: 3.65/4.0</p>"},{"location":"Projects/","title":"Talcott Resolution Software Engineer (2023 - present)","text":"<p>Project work will include: ETL, Python, &amp; SQL</p>"},{"location":"Projects/#optum-2020-2023","title":"Optum (2020-2023)","text":""},{"location":"Projects/#software-engineer-full-time","title":"Software Engineer (full-time)","text":"<ul> <li>Docker Schedule Check Jenkins Pipeline   I developed a Jenkins pipeline for an organization that runs daily to build and test all submitted Dockerfiles from another Jenkins pipeline. Each Dockerfile had specifications on how to build them, and images were pushed to an Azure ACR for scanning by the Defender to detect vulnerabilities. I used a graphQuery API call to access the resulting vulnerability scores, and Dockerfile owners were alerted via email with remediation guidelines if severe vulnerabilities were found. </li> <li>API Kubernetes Deployment  I developed a RESTful API using Connexion, a Python framework similar to Flask, which runs in a Docker container on a Gunicorn server. The container is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using a Jenkins pipeline, with the ability to scale replicas as needed. I verified the functionality of the API endpoints using kubectl CLI with port forwarding and Postman. </li> <li> <p>ML Data Preparation &amp; Training  I wrote Python scripts to build data pipelines that trained and tested speech and language ML models for UnitedHealth Group. This involved implementing complex data preparation logic to ensure proper alignment and structure of transcriptions. In addition, I created Jupyter notebooks to run tests and evaluate model performance under different scenarios, and presented the results during sprint demos to the team.</p> </li> <li> <p> Microsite Logging &amp; Kibana Dashboard  I Implemented Elastic Search logging across all of the organization's microsites, enabling OAuth user identification to track user navigation paths. Configured a Kibana dashboard with interactive visualizations that allow management to quickly identify problematic resources and prioritize improvements.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Projects/#software-engineer-intern","title":"Software Engineer (Intern)","text":"<ul> <li> Fenway Health React App Scheduler  Scrum master and product owner on an intern team of 5 software engineers.

The script leverages the Python Yfinance library to access real-time stock data, calculates key indicators such as moving averages and identifies potential breakout opportunities. The script integrates with the Twilio texting API to send automated notifications to subscribed users. Additionally, I set up and automated paper trading using the Alpaca broker Python API.</li> <li>Sitetracker - WPI, React Mobile App  I created a mobile application for construction site project managers to prioritize tasks over project sites that they manage.
