I have over 3 years of professional experiencee working in the software industry and have had the opportunity to work on some exciting and impactful technologies. When it comes to software development, I strive to be a team player. I enjoy working closely with my colleagues and stakeholders to understand their business needs and goals. This has always resulted in creative solutions that meet their requirements while also adhering to best practices and industry standards. Outside of work, I enjoy scripting useful functionality for my stock trading alerting Python application. The application utilizes the Python Requests library with HTTP GET requests to pull stock recommendations from various source each day. Then the Python Yfinance library is used to acquire real time price data for a given day. I am able to receive text notifications on potential breakouts through the Twilio texting API. If you're interested in learning more about my experience and skills, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I'd love to elaborate on how I can help your organization achieve its goals through software engineering!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#peter-luro-personal-microsite","text":"","title":"Peter Luro Personal Microsite"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"My name is Peter Luro, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for building sofisticated scalable solutions that tackle complex technological tasks.
