Dockerfiles built through a configuration json, submitted through a second Jenkins pipeline, then the images pushed to Azure ACR to be scanned by theure Defender. Vulnerability scores are then accessed Azure GraphQuery and ownrer's of Dockerfiles with high vulnerability scores are notified via email. The email also contains remediation guidelines on how to resolve the vulnerabilities found. Internships Kibana visualization dashboards for Medical claim analytics on UHG payments. First place winner of the Boston Global Hackathon and placed second nationally. Developed a mobaile application which would incentivize youth to follow healthy daily routines. Additional Projects Python Trading App - configured daily alerts identifying high probability setups in stock price fluctuations from morning recommendations that are pulled from various sources using Python GET requests. Real time stock price data is gathered by yfinance Python library and sms notifications are sent through Twilio texting API identifying potential breakouts.","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#optum","text":"","title":"Optum"},{"location":"projects/#scheduled-docker-vulnerability-alerting","text":"Configured a Jenkins pipeline to build and test all of the organization\u2019s project Dockerfiles for vulnerabilities on a daily scheduled check.
