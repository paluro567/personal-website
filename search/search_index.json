I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from WPI and have worked with a variety of programming languages including Python, SQL, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, React, Swagger (YAML), CSS & HTML. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a range of exciting projects, from building mobile applications to developing complex enterprise-level software solutions. I pride myself on my ability to work well under pressure, meet tight deadlines, and deliver high-quality code that is both efficient and maintainable. In my free time, I enjoy scripting useful functionality for my day trading side hobby. I have also tested completely automated day trading, using recommendations from various sources attained by Python GET requests. If you're interested in learning more about my work or have a project in mind that you think I could help with, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always excited to collaborate with new people and tackle new challenges!

Dockerfiles are built using a configuration settings json, submitted through a second Jenkins pipeline, then the images pushed to an Azure ACR to be scanned by the Defender. Vulnerability scores are then accessed by an Azure GraphQuery call and owner's of the project Dockerfiles, with high vulnerability scores, are notified via email. The email contains remediation guidelines on how to resolve the vulnerabilities found. Wrote Python scripts to process audio data for training speech & language UHG ML models. Configured Jupyter notebooks for comparing various models and outcomes, generating reports that highlight key differences. Configured Elastic Search Kibana logging for the organization's microsites with user identification, through the use of an OAuth OIDC client. Structured visualizations and analytics in a Kibana dashboard, which are referenced by management to identify pain points in resources. Jenkins pipelines and scripting to clean out \"stale\" resources in specified Azure subscriptions. Restructured engineering sites to make cloud documentation more easily discoverable by engineers. Presented Figma wireframe design proposals in sprint demos to finalize a design. Software Engineering Intern Kibana visualization dashboards for medical claim analytics on UHG payments. First place winner of the Boston Global Hackathon and placed second nationally. Developed a mobile application which would incentivize youth to follow healthy daily routines. Additional Projects Python Trading App - configured daily sms alerts identifying high probability setups in stock price fluctuations, utilizing morning recommendations that are pulled from various sources by Python GET requests. Real time stock price data is gathered by yfinance Python library and sms notifications are sent through the Twilio texting API, alerting potential breakouts. Sitetracker - configured a React mobile application for construction site project managers to schedule tasks and work elements by project.","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#optum","text":"","title":"Optum"},{"location":"projects/#full-time-software-engineer","text":"Scheduled Docker Vulnerability Alerting - Configured a Jenkins pipeline to build and test all of the organization\u2019s project Dockerfiles for vulnerabilities on a daily scheduled check.
