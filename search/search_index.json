I have over 3 years of professional experience working in the software industry and have had the opportunity to work on some exciting and impactful technologies.</p> <p>When it comes to software development, I strive to be a team player. I enjoy working closely with my colleagues and stakeholders to understand their business needs and goals. This has always resulted in creative solutions that meet their requirements while also adhering to best practices and industry standards.</p> <p>Outside of work, I enjoy scripting useful functionality for my stock trading Python application. The application runs in GCP cloud on a daily crontab schedule and utilizes the Python Requests library with HTTP GET requests and authorization headers to pull stock recommendations from various sources each day. Then using the Python Alpha Vantage API, I am able to pull real-time stock data and place automated buy and sell orders to complete an entirely automated trading system that has been profitable so far!</p> <p>If you're interested in learning more about my experience and skills, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I'd love to elaborate on how I can help your organization achieve its goals through software engineering!</p>"},{"location":"#education","title":"Education","text":"<p>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science - Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) - GPA: 3.65/4.0</p>"},{"location":"Projects/","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"Projects/#talcott-resolution-2023-present","title":"Talcott Resolution (2023 - present) <p>Software Engineer (full-time)</p> <ul> <li> Datalake Market Data Automation &amp; Processing   Implemented a configurable Autosys automation framework capable of handling diverse data sources such as market data files delivered via scheduled emails, file drops, or other means. Each data process is encapsulated into its own modular and reusable component within the organization's Python Datalake project. My implementation promotes code reusability and extensibility, allowing for easy integration of new data sources and future enhancements without the need for significant modifications.</li> <li>Full-Stack 1065 Tax Form  Structured a full-stack React application for the organization to submit 1065 tax forms to a database and incorporated logic to enable  versioning of submissions.</li> <li>Revamaped Company Site with Embedded Power BI Reports  Improved accessibility for management to upload new files with company data and visualize through embedded Power BI reports.</li> </ul>","text":""},{"location":"Projects/#optum-2017-2023","title":"Optum (2017-2023) <p>Software Engineer (full-time)</p> <ul> <li>Docker Schedule Check Jenkins Pipeline   Developed a Jenkins pipeline for an organization that runs daily to build and test all submitted Dockerfiles from another Jenkins pipeline. Each Dockerfile had specifications on how to build them, and images were pushed to an Azure ACR for scanning by the Defender to detect vulnerabilities. I used a graphQuery API call to access the resulting vulnerability scores, and Dockerfile owners were alerted via email with remediation guidelines if severe vulnerabilities were found. </li> <li>API Kubernetes Deployment  Developed a RESTful API using Connexion, a Python framework similar to Flask, which runs in a Docker container on a Gunicorn server. The container is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using a Jenkins pipeline, with the ability to scale replicas as needed. I verified the functionality of the API endpoints using kubectl CLI with port forwarding and Postman. </li> <li> <p>ML Data Preparation &amp; Training  Wrote Python scripts to build data pipelines that trained and tested speech and language ML models for UnitedHealth Group. This involved implementing complex data preparation logic to ensure proper alignment and structure of transcriptions. In addition, I created Jupyter notebooks to run tests and evaluate model performance under different scenarios, and presented the results during sprint demos to the team.</p> </li> <li> <p> Microsite Logging &amp; Kibana Dashboard  Implemented Elastic Search logging across all of the organization's microsites, enabling OAuth user identification to track user navigation paths. Configured a Kibana dashboard with interactive visualizations that allow management to quickly identify problematic resources and prioritize improvements.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Software Engineer (Intern)</p> <ul> <li> Fenway Health - React App Scheduler  Scrum master and product owner on an intern team of 5 software engineers. Developed a React app appointment scheduler for Fenway Health to schedule appointments for their patients.</li> <li> Kibana Microsite Analytical Dashboard  Utilized Spark SQL in Azure Databricks to query UHG claims data, and indexed it using Elasticsearch-Hadoop connector to create Kibana dashboards. The dashboards contained statistical visuals that allowed management to identify wasteful spending by the company.</li> <li> Boston Global Hackathon Winner  Won first place at the Boston location and won second nationally.

The script leverages the Python Yfinance library to access real-time stock data, calculates key indicators such as moving averages and identifies potential breakout opportunities. The script integrates with the Twilio texting API to send automated notifications to subscribed users.
