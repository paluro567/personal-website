I have over 3 years of professional experience working in the software industry and have had the opportunity to work on some exciting and impactful technologies.</p> <p>When it comes to software development, I strive to be a team player. I enjoy working closely with my colleagues and stakeholders to understand their business needs and goals. This has always resulted in creative solutions that meet their requirements while also adhering to best practices and industry standards.</p> <p>Outside of work, I enjoy scripting useful functionality for my stock trading Python application. The application runs in GCP cloud on a daily crontab schedule and utilizes the Python Requests library with HTTP GET requests and authorization headers to pull stock recommendations from various sources each day. Then using the Python Alpha Vantage API, I am able to pull real-time stock data and place automated buy and sell orders to complete an entirely automated trading system that has been profitable so far!</p> <p>If you're interested in learning more about my experience and skills, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I'd love to elaborate on how I can help your organization achieve its goals through software engineering!</p>"},{"location":"#education","title":"Education","text":"<p>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science - Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) - GPA: 3.65/4.0</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>LinkedIn Email: peter.luro1@gmail.com Phone Number: 978-621-9450  Location: West Hartford, CT 06119</p>"}]}
